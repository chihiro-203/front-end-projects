# Front-end Projects

Thanks for visiting my **Front-end Projects**.

I undertake these projects because I want to further enhance my skills to become a Front-end Developer. If you have interest, then join and practice at [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://50projects50days.com/)

For each project, I include a short description and a live demo.
