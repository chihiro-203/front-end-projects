2. **Description:** 
    - Developed the "Profile Github" project, which features an input bar accompanied by a waiting cat image. 
    - Users can input a GitHub username and press "Enter" to fetch and display the user's information, including avatar, name, bio, followers, following count, and public repositories. 
    - Especially, the avatar will be presented in a cat-ear frame.
    - If a new GitHub username is entered, the card temporarily shows the waiting cat image, but if the input is cleared without pressing "Enter," the previous user's information reappears.
    
3. **Purpose:** 
    - To provide an interactive and visually appealing interface for retrieving and displaying GitHub user information..
    - To enhance user experience with dynamic content updates and playful design elements that maintain engagement and provide clear feedback based on user actions.
